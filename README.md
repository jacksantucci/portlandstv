This repository contains data and R code used to produce tables and figures for two reports:

Kosar, Kevin R., Jack Santucci, and Jaehun Lee. 2025.  <a href="https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/an-initial-assessment-of-proportional-ranked-choice-voting-in-portland-oregon/"><i>An Initial Assessment of Proportional Ranked-Choice Voting in Portland, Oregon</i></a>. American Enterprise Institute.

Kosar, Kevin R., Jack Santucci, and Jaehun Lee. 2025. <a href="https://manhattan.institute/article/portland-city-elections-toward-two-parties-more-or-none"><i>Portland City Elections: Toward Two Parties, More, or None?</i></a> American Enterprise Institute</a> and Manhattan Institute.

Data include cast-vote records (CVRs) by council district and interest-group endorsements of candidates. To run the code that uses CVRs, you first need to unzip the file "portland city council cvrs.zip."

Please cite the first report above if you are working with CVR data. Please cite the second if you are working with endorsement data. Thanks!
